## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for learning clean architecture with test driven development and bloc state management. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app]([https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab](https://resocoder.com/2019/08/27/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course-1-explanation-project-structure/)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
